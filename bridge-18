The Bridge design pattern is a structural pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge, making the functionality of concrete classes independent from the interface implementer classes. The Bridge pattern is useful when both the class and what it does vary often, which would otherwise require a large number of subclasses.

Key Components of the Bridge Design Pattern
Abstraction: The abstract class that defines the abstract interface.
Refined Abstraction: A subclass of the Abstraction that provides more specific implementations.
Implementor: The interface that defines the methods to be implemented by the concrete implementations.
Concrete Implementor: The classes that implement the Implementor interface and provide concrete implementations.
Example: Bridge Design Pattern
Let's consider an example where we want to draw different shapes with different colors. We have two dimensions of variability here: shapes and colors.

Implementor
This is the interface that defines methods related to colors.

java
Copy code
interface Color {
    void applyColor();
}
Concrete Implementor
These are the classes that implement the Color interface.

java
Copy code
class RedColor implements Color {
    @Override
    public void applyColor() {
        System.out.println("Applying red color");
    }
}

class GreenColor implements Color {
    @Override
    public void applyColor() {
        System.out.println("Applying green color");
    }
}
Abstraction
This is the abstract class that represents the shape.

java
Copy code
abstract class Shape {
    protected Color color;

    protected Shape(Color color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    abstract void draw();
}
Refined Abstraction
These are the concrete classes that extend the Shape class.

java
Copy code
class Circle extends Shape {
    public Circle(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.print("Drawing Circle in ");
        color.applyColor();
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    public Square(Color color) {
        super(color);
    }

    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.print("Drawing Square in ");
        color.applyColor();
    }
}
Client Code
This is the client code that uses the bridge pattern.

java
Copy code
public class BridgePatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape redCircle = new Circle(new RedColor());
        Shape greenSquare = new Square(new GreenColor());

        redCircle.draw();
        greenSquare.draw();
    }
}
Explanation
Color (Implementor): An interface that defines a method for applying color.
RedColor and GreenColor (Concrete Implementors): Implement the Color interface and provide specific implementations of the applyColor method.
Shape (Abstraction): An abstract class that holds a reference to a Color object. It has an abstract draw method that must be implemented by subclasses.
Circle and Square (Refined Abstraction): Concrete classes that extend the Shape class and implement the draw method, using the Color object to apply the color.
